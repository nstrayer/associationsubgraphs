\usage{
calc_entropy_net(
  pairs,
  id_col,
  target_col,
  count_col,
  info_func = associationsubgraphs::calc_mutual_info,
  possible_targets,
  parallel = TRUE,
  subset_pairs = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pairs}{Dataframe with at least two columns: \code{id} and \code{target}. \code{id}
corresponds to the variables to be associated with each other and \code{target}
corresponds to the observations they had. This is in essence a tidy version
of an tabular dataset with columns as \code{id} and rows as \code{target}. If data is
count based an addition \code{count} column can be included. (Not yet
implemented).}

\item{id_col}{Name of column containing variable id (I.e. nodes of the
association network).}

\item{target_col}{Name of the column containing the target for occurance
(I.e. the data used to infer association between nodes).}

\item{count_col}{Name of column containing count values as integers. If this
is not set and no column with title \code{count} is included in \code{pairs} then
entropy will be run on binary occurrence.}

\item{info_func}{What information function should be used? Like all of the
\verb{calc_*} functions in this package this takes as its arguments two paired
vectors of observations as input and returns a number corresponding to
strength of association.}

\item{possible_targets}{If there are some \code{target} values that are never seen
in your dataset then they can be provided here with the form of a
characterr, factor, or integer vector of all target values.}

\item{parallel}{Should the processing be run in parallel? Three options. A
logical \code{TRUE} will run in parallel over every core available using
\code{future::multisession}. A number will run in parallel over that many cores.
E.g. \code{parallel = 5} will run in parallel on \code{5} core. Last, for the most
control a \code{future} processing plan can be passed (I.e. what is run by
\code{future::plan()} to set up your parallel processing environment.) This
allows you to run on clusters etc..}

\item{subset_pairs}{Should the algorithm be run on a random subset of
possible combinations? Useful for making sure everything is good before
running larger jobs. Set to the number of pairs you want to calculate
strength for. If reproducability is desired use \code{set.seed()}.}

\item{verbose}{Information about steps is written to console.}

\description{
Takes a dataset of occurence or count observations and runs a pair-wise
information network over all combinations of variables.
