<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `entropynet` is to provide tools to build robust entropy
association networks from both binary occurrence and count data.
Includes functions for investigating the found networks through
visualization and various network-analysis statistics.

## Installation

The package `V8` needs to be installed and can be a tiny bit tricky. If
you get an error run:

``` bash
# (Debian / Ubuntu)
apt-get install libv8-dev

# (OSX)
brew install v8
```

Follow the error messages for other operating systems.

To install the package from from [GitHub](https://github.com/) run:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nstrayer/entropynet")
```
